I was picking up my friend to go get some food and we both noticed this new restaurant on 109 st. At the time, we weren't sure if it was open. It turns out at the time, they
were still putting the finishing touches to their preparations! A month later, my friend and I went to check it out. When we walked in, the restaurant was really clean
and nice interior. We were greeted by the waitress working there, and took our seats.<br/><br/>

We got our menus and began to take a look. The one thing I noticed is the amount of variety and items they have on their menu.
Their menu covered the following: tempura, sushi pizza, ramen, udon, sushi, pressed sushi, sashimi, donburi and more!<br/><br/>

These are the dishes that we got.<br/><br/>

Chef's Choice Deluxe Sashimi<br/><br/>
The Chef's choice came with Salmon, Tuna, Red fin, octopus, Sockeye Salmon, Tuna and . The sashimi was pretty standard we found. The fish is fairly fresh and tasted good but not
overly amazing. It was on the pricier side, but that's because the sashimi is on the thicccker side.<br/><br/>

Unagi Sushi Pizza <br/><br/>
The unagi sushi pizza was surprisingly really good. It was topped with unagi suace and avocado. The outside was nice and crispy but the rice on the inside was not mushy at all.
It had a slight vinegar flavor from the sushi rice but not mushy. This was really good and surprised us.<br/><br/>

# Okonomoyaki image
The japanese pancake was pretty good. It tasted very good and had a lot of good flavor.<br/><br/>

# Agedashi Tofu
The agedashi tofu was very crispy. They gave a good amount and the dipping sauce it came with had a lot of flavor.<br/><br/>

# Pressed Chopped Scallop
The pressed scallop sushi tasted fine. It had a nice sear. The sushi rice was good and the scallop was good too. But my only complaint was that the rice to fish
ratio was a bit off. I felt like I was eating too much rice compared to the amount of fish.<br/><br/>

Overall, we really enjoyed our food and were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food despite the amount of items they had. These are our final verdict:<br/><br/>
* Taste: 4/5
* Value: 3/5
* Presentation: 4/5

* Overall: I would totally come here again to try other things (like the lobster udon)
